synopsis: cabal haddock-project warns the user whn `--gen-index` is not passed
          and if that's the case doesn't print a message that `index.html` was
          created, since it wasn't.

          The same PR aslo fixes a bug which allows to use `haddock-project`
          with packages which contain sublibraries.
